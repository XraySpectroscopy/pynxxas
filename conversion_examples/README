These examples are essentially built by hand as proof-of-principle
and as points of discussion to drive the pynxxas and NXxas definition.


For all datasets:

1. "intensity" is edge-step normalized XAS.  The processing steps are
    done with xraylarch, but in a way (linear pre-edge, constant edge step),
    that it should be easy to reproduce.

2. "New" XDI files are written to very, very closely match the NXxas Groups.

3. The group "rawdata" holds the "original" column data.  It also
   includes (in column 2, the "intensity"/"normalized mu(E)" so that
   the data shape is identical to the new XDI file


The scripts are pretty "hacky" and not meant for real use in pynnxas, but more
of a guide.  My intention is to *not* rely on larch, but to port code to
robustly read text files, and do basic processing (including pre-edge
subtraction and normalization) into pynxxas.



Folders and Files (so far):
=============================

Fe_XDIFiles:  3 XDI files (all Fe K edge, transmsission XAFS)
      are put into a single nexus file.

MultiElementFluor:  12 data files (XDI-ish) for V K-edge fluoresence XAFS
      using a 4-element detector.  The original files have columns saved
      for "V Ka" and a "Deadtime Correction Factor" for MCAs 1 through 4.
      The script sums the deadtime-corrected chanbels to make "ifluor".
      V_XANES_nexus.h5


KEK_PF: 1 data file from Photon Factory, KEK.  Fluorescence XAFS,
      recorded as a function of angle
